/*
******************************** DAGGER 2 ************************************

2 ways to do dependency injection -
    1. Constructor injection - dependencies of class are passed in the constructor
    2. Field injection - dependencies are instantiated after class is created.

Alternative to Dagger 2 is Service Locator.
* ServiceLocator class creates and store dependencies and then provides those dependencies on demand.

With ServiceLocator pattern - classes have control and ask for objects to be injected
With DI pattern - app has control and proactively injects the required objects.
